### Custom Command + CLAUDE.md = Automatic Context Management

#### CLAUDE.md (condensed example)

```
# Project Configuration ## Development Rules - Always use memory-keeper to track progress - Save architectural decisions and test results - Create checkpoints before context limits ## Quality Standards - All tests must pass before marking complete - Document actual vs claimed results
```


#### Custom Command Example: /my-dev-workflow

```
/my-dev-workflow
```


```
# My Development Workflow When working on the provided project: - Use memory-keeper with channel: <project_name> - Save progress at every major milestone - Document all decisions with category: "decision" - Track implementation status with category: "progress" - Before claiming anything is complete, save test results ## Workflow Steps 1. Initialize session with project name as channel 2. Save findings during investigation 3. Create checkpoint before major changes 4. Document what actually works vs what should work
```


#### Usage Example

```
User: /my-dev-workflow authentication-service AI: Setting up workflow for authentication-service. [Uses memory-keeper with channel "authentication-service"] [... AI works, automatically saving context ...] User: "Getting close to context limit. Create checkpoint and give me a key" AI: "Checkpoint created: authentication-service-checkpoint-20250126-143026" [Continue working until context reset or compact manually] User: "Restore from key: authentication-service-checkpoint-20250126-143026" AI: "Restored! Continuing OAuth implementation. We completed the token validation, working on refresh logic..."
```


```
User: /my-dev-workflow authentication-service AI: Setting up workflow for authentication-service. [Uses memory-keeper with channel "authentication-service"] [... AI works, automatically saving context ...] User: "Getting close to context limit. Create checkpoint and give me a key" AI: "Checkpoint created: authentication-service-checkpoint-20250126-143026" [Continue working until context reset or compact manually] User: "Restore from key: authentication-service-checkpoint-20250126-143026" AI: "Restored! Continuing OAuth implementation. We completed the token validation, working on refresh logic..."
```

The Pattern:
1. Custom command includes instructions to use memory-keeper
2. AI follows those instructions automatically
3. When you notice the conversation getting long, YOU ask Claude to save a checkpoint (like saving your game before a boss fight!)
4. When Claude runs out of space and starts fresh, YOU tell it to restore using the checkpoint key
🎯 Key Feature: Memory Keeper is a shared board! You can:
- Continue in the same session after reset
- Start a completely new session and restore
- Have multiple Claude sessions running in parallel, all sharing the same memory
- One session can save context that another session retrieves
This enables powerful workflows like having one Claude session doing research while another implements code, both sharing discoveries through Memory Keeper!
